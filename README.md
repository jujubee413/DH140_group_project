### _A Look Into Our Research Question_


The Olympics are a globally celebrated event intended to bring honor and pride to countries and their citizens around the world. Although such extravagant and awe inspiring events often achieve this, they also achieve costing billions of dollars over budget which are ultimately left to be paid by the host country. Because of these downsides, as is said by [Buisness Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/future-olympics-no-country-wants-to-host-games-2018-2), less and less countries are vying for the opportunity to host such games in order to avoid the pricey budget that comes with them. Through our research we hope to examine in what ways do the Olympics truly affect both economically and socially the host country of which they happen, and how has the introduction of women's events changed these affects? In addition, we also hope to find out how the Olympics affect host country athletic performance, as well as local and national economies. In the end, we hope our research will provide insight into the true global effects of the games, and can get a clearer picture about the possible way we could save the dying tradition.

### __Why this is important for *US, for YOU,* and what's *at stake*__

The Olympics are a global symbol of many things; unity, strength, and the resolve of athletes who spend their entire lives working to compete for their nation's honor. While the Olympics not only stand to inspire many of us to feel pride in our country, they also have a resounding impact on society and the host country's local economy. As fans of the Olympics and as people who see value in their contribution to society, we chose this data for its importance to our own personal interest. Like so many other Americans, we feel as though sports are a unifying factor for our nation and among other countries and because of this, weâ€™d like to see them continue. We also know this is the case for many others, and so by studying this data ourselves, we hope to bring light to the situation in order to inspire others to take action to save the games. We hope that our research can inspire dialogue about the changes that could be made to the olympics in order to address the massive amounts of waste and economic loss that result from hosting the games (such as empty rotting stadiums, pollution) Ultimately, without such dialogue , the games are likely to continue on the same path as now. This would mean an end to the long held tradition that has united countries for over the last century.
