#### Roles
Although we will be diving the work equally, we will devote our energy to also utilizing our strenghts in this project.
This means that __*Adam*__ will be taking on the role of _"Code Consultant"_. This means that because Adam is more familiar with coding, that he will help oversee the logistics and flow of the coding in our project. This includes devoting his knowledge of coding to help drive our direction
of research in a way that will be plausible with the data we have.
On the other hand, while Adam is our coding consultant, __*Juliette*__ will be the _Narrative director_. Her responsibilities will include crafting the main narrative and scope for the project. She will help find datsets
that will help advance this narrative and work with Adam to create effective visualizations to do so.
#### Mood and Current Project Status
I believe the best word to describe our teams mood is optimistic! We are both learning alot and enjoying the unique challenges that have come with the class without yet feeling overwhelmed.
Luckily, most problems have not been to hard to fix lately, and we are hoping to keep the good energy and coding rolling into the coming weeks.
While most things have been going great, we have found ourselves frustrated by the memory capacity of Jupyterhub. Because our datasets includes years of global data, we find that we quickly exhuast Jupyterhubs capabilities. We will have to be mindful of this going intot he future and look into cutting the datasets down to more manageable pieces.
#### Data Update
Currently we find that our datasets are indeed helping us explore our research question of "What are the Societal and Economic impacts of the Olympics". Through Juliettes dataset, she has
been able to expose the rising costs per athelete and per event of the olympics over the years, which adds to our narrative that the Olympics may play a role in hurting the local economies that host them Her data can be found through [here](https://data.world/sports/olympics). Adam has used GeoJason data in conjunction with data from the World bank in order to find that many athletes come from highly developed economical countries. This helps add to our data that a economic impact of the Olympics is the cost associated with sending athletes. His data can be found [here]( https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries#resource-geo-countries_zip). We will continue to work with datasets like [this](https://data.world/sports/women-in-the-olympic-games) that will reveal the effect of increased event totals and the rise of womens participation on economic costs. In the end, there is more work to be done, but our evidence is compelling in that we are motivtated to find out the true impacts the games have had on global societies and economies.
#### Concerns
A minor concern that our team has moving forward is the concern that we may not be focused enough in finding data that answers the scope of our research question. There are many routes we could choose to take to analyze the effects of the Olympics, and we will have to be vigilent to make sure our research focus is detailed enough to prove significant results.
Other Minor Concerns include: Finding compelling evidence that supports our claim, turning in work on time, and making sure we are reviewing new coding techniques.
Major concerns include: fearing having an idea that we cannot execute, whether it be from insufficient data to support it or not knowing the coding cunftions to visualize the data. 
Another major concern is not finding any unqiue or compelling evidence in the end of our project, and thus not having a concludable research question.

Overall, we are optimistic that we will be able to handle future challenges and finding compelling evidance that support our research question.
