#### Roles
Although we will be diving the work equally, we will devote our energy to also utilizing our strenghts in this project.
This means that __*Adam*__ will be taking on the role of _"Code Consultant"_. This means that because Adam is more familiar with coding, that he will help oversee the logistics and flow of the coding in our project. This includes devoting his knowledge of coding to help drive our direction
of research in a way that will be plausible with the data we have.
On the other hand, while Adam is our coding consultant, __*Juliette*__ will be the _Narrative director_. Her responsibilities will include crafting the main narrative and scope for the project. She will help find datsets
that will help advance this narrative and work with Adam to create effective visualizations to do so.
#### Mood and Current Project Status
I believe the best word to describe our teams mood is optimistic! We are both learning alot and enjoying the unique challenges that have come with the class without yet feeling overwhelmed.
Luckily, most problems have not been to hard to fix lately, and we are hoping to keep the good energy and coding rolling into the coming weeks.
While most things have been going great, we have found ourselves frustrated by the memory capacity of Jupyterhub. Because our datasets includes years of global data, we find that we quickly exhuast Jupyterhubs capabilities. We will have to be mindful of this going intot he future and look into cutting the datasets down to more manageable pieces.
#### Data Update
Currently we find that our datasets are indeed helping us explore our research question of "What are the Societal and Economic impacts of the Olympics". Through Juliettes dataset, she has
been able to expose the rising costs per athelete and per event of the olympics over the years, which adds to our narrative that the Olympics may play a role in hurting the local economies that host them Her data can be found through [here](https://data.world/sports/olympics). Adam has used GeoJason data in conjunction with data from the World bank in order to find that many athletes come from highly developed economical countries. This helps add to our data that a economic impact of the Olympics is the cost associated with sending athletes. His data can be found [here]( https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries#resource-geo-countries_zip). We will continue to work with datasets like [this](https://data.world/sports/women-in-the-olympic-games) that will reveal the effect of increased event totals and the rise of womens participation on economic costs. In the end, there is more work to be done, but our evidence is compelling in that we are motivtated to find out the true impacts the games have had on global societies and economies.
#### Concerns
Overall, we have relatively little concerns, but we do believe our biggest challenge continueing forward will be making sure that our scope of research is focused enough. There are many routes we could choose to take to analyze the effects of the Olympics, but we will be vigilent to make sure our research focus is detailed enough to prove significant results.
Another valid concern is the fear of having an idea that we cannot execute, but we are sure with our curiosity and resilience that we can make it through whatever challanges appear.
